# RUOK Databases

How RUOK's database layer works, how to configure **either** backend, how
migrations are run, and how to back up and recover data with native tools.

RUOK supports exactly two mutually exclusive backends:

| Backend | `DATABASE_TYPE` | Data location | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| SQLite | `sqlite` (default) | a single local file (`DATABASE_PATH`) | a single small/self-hosted installation |
| PostgreSQL | `postgres` | an externally managed server (`DATABASE_URL`) | a shared server, one RUOK replica backed by CNPG or any PostgreSQL 16/17 |

Each deployment uses **exactly one** configured backend. Switching the
`DATABASE_TYPE` environment variable does **not** transfer data and is not a
supported way to move an installation (see
[Backend switching is not a migration](#backend-switching-is-not-a-migration)).

This guide is the source of truth for database operations. The other docs link
here rather than duplicating it.

## Configuration reference

All settings are environment/bootstrap variables. They are read and validated
by `loadConfig` at startup and by the standalone migration CLI. Unknown or
contradictory values are rejected with an actionable message — there is **never**
a silent fallback to the other backend.

| Variable | Applies to | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_TYPE` | both | `sqlite` | `sqlite` or `postgres` only; anything else is rejected |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | SQLite | `data/okr.db` | Filesystem path to the SQLite file. **Ignored in PostgreSQL mode.** |
| `SQLITE_JOURNAL_MODE` | SQLite | `wal` | `wal` or `delete`. `wal` needs suitable local/block storage; no NFS correctness is claimed. |
| `SQLITE_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS` | SQLite | `5000` | Non-negative bounded busy timeout. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL | *(none)* | **Required** in PostgreSQL mode. Full `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db` URL. Never logged. |
| `DATABASE_SSL_MODE` | PostgreSQL | `disable` | `disable` or `verify-full`. `verify-full` requires hostname/CA validation; never silently downgraded. |
| `DATABASE_SSL_CA_FILE` | PostgreSQL | *(none)* | Container path to a PEM CA file (mounted secret) when using verified TLS. |
| `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` | PostgreSQL | `5` | Bounded positive integer pool size. |
| `DATABASE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` | PostgreSQL | `10000` | Bounded startup connect wait. |
| `DATABASE_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS` | PostgreSQL | `30000` | Bounded per-statement timeout (see [migration timeout](#migration-timeout)). |

`PORT`, `HOST`, `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `DATA_DIR` are not database settings; they
are described in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

See `.env.example` for a ready-to-copy template with inline comments.

## Environment variable precedence

There is exactly one place where an environment object becomes a validated
database config: `loadConfig`. Because RUOK does not use a dotenv library at
runtime, precedence is simple and deterministic:

1. `DATABASE_TYPE` selects the backend (`sqlite` default).
2. For the selected backend, each explicit environment variable takes the value
   you set. An unset optional variable uses its documented default.
3. `DATABASE_PATH` is **only** meaningful when `DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite`. In
   PostgreSQL mode it is deliberately ignored (the legacy Docker environment
   sets it); it does not open or create a SQLite file.

For TLS there are two sources that must not contradict each other:

- An explicit `DATABASE_SSL_MODE`.
- TLS hints in `DATABASE_URL` (`sslmode=require|verify-ca|verify-full`) and the
  presence of `DATABASE_SSL_CA_FILE`.

The rules that prevent silent TLS downgrade are enforced with errors:

- `DATABASE_SSL_MODE=disable` **plus** a URL asking for verification, or
  **plus** a `DATABASE_SSL_CA_FILE`, is rejected (refusing to silently disable
  verification).
- A CA file set while no explicit mode is present implies `verify-full`.
- A URL with a verifying `sslmode` while no explicit mode is present implies
  `verify-full`.

A missing `DATABASE_URL` in PostgreSQL mode is rejected before any connection
attempt.

---

## SQLite mode

SQLite is the default and keeps the legacy `DATABASE_PATH`/`data/okr.db`
behavior. It is best for a single installation on local or block storage.

```bash
cd okr-app
export DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite                 # optional; this is the default
export DATABASE_PATH=/path/to/okr.db        # optional; default data/okr.db
npm install
npm run db:migrate                          # create/upgrade the schema
npm run dev
```

### Journal mode and WAL

SQLite runs with foreign-key enforcement enabled, a bounded busy timeout and a
configured journal mode (`wal` by default). WAL gives better concurrency but
requires suitable **local/block storage**. RUOK makes **no claim of NFS
correctness**: do not place the SQLite file (or its `-wal`/`-shm` side files)
on a network filesystem. If a `DELETE` journal is required for a supported
operational reason, set `SQLITE_JOURNAL_MODE=delete`.

### Legacy preflight

RUOK supports upgrading a supported existing SQLite file, including a known
`db:push`-era layout. On startup/migration the layout is fingerprinted and, for
a recognized legacy layout, adopted only after structural + data-integrity
checks, recording the reconciled migration journal atomically. An **unknown** or
incompatible layout **fails with an actionable message before serving
requests** — there is no warn-and-continue repair and no partially-applied
history.

> **Production `db:push` is replaced.** `db:push` (Drizzle Kit) creates/alters
> schema directly and is unsuitable for a running installation. Use the
> versioned migration runner (`npm run db:migrate` / `npm run db:verify`) shown
> below. `db:push` remains only as a dev convenience for a throwaway database.

---

## PostgreSQL mode

Set `DATABASE_TYPE=postgres` and provide `DATABASE_URL`. PostgreSQL keeps all
data in the external server; RUOK never opens or creates a SQLite file in this
mode.

```bash
cd okr-app
export DATABASE_TYPE=postgres
export DATABASE_URL='postgresql://ruok:CHANGE_ME@db.example.com:5432/ruok'
export DATABASE_SSL_MODE=verify-full
export DATABASE_SSL_CA_FILE=/run/secrets/ca.pem   # mounted CA, verified TLS
npm install
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev
```

### Supported versions and privileges

PostgreSQL 16 and 17 are the initial supported/CI-tested major versions.
Verify the actual server major version before deployment and do not claim
support beyond tested versions. RUOK needs an application-owned schema/database
and **does not require superuser** or the ability to create databases. It uses a
bounded connection pool and per-statement timeouts.

### TLS (verified, custom CA)

TLS is either `disable` (default) or `verify-full`. `verify-full` performs
hostname + CA validation and **never** silently downgrades (see
[precedence](#environment-variable-precedence)). To use a private CNPG CA,
mount the PEM into the container (for example `./secrets:/run/secrets:ro` in
[`compose.postgres.yml`](../compose.postgres.yml)) and set both
`DATABASE_SSL_MODE=verify-full` and `DATABASE_SSL_CA_FILE`. The CA file is a
mounted secret, never baked into the image. A missing CA file fails before
connect.

### Connection pool limits

`DATABASE_POOL_MAX` bounds concurrent connections (default `5`). The default
deployment is **one** application replica, so this is the total connection
demand RUOK makes on the server. `DATABASE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` bounds startup
connect waits and `DATABASE_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS` bounds individual statements.

### Migration timeout

A long migration may exceed the default 30 s statement timeout. If you run
migrations on a large dataset, you may raise `DATABASE_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS`
for the migration run specifically (documented override); the value is read from
the environment so you can set it just for the migration job and leave the
runtime at the default.

---

## Migrations and startup protocol

Migrations are **independent, versioned per dialect** and executed by the same
canonical runner used at startup. Historical SQLite migration files are
**preserved and never rewritten**. A migration never marks unapplied migrations
as applied.

Two distinct entry points, both shipped in the production image:

- **`npm run db:migrate`** — the standalone migration CLI (default mode). Runs
  the selected backend's checked migration history. No app server needed.
- **`MIGRATION_MODE=verify npm run db:migrate`** (or **`npm run db:verify`**) —
  schema **verification only**; no DDL. It classifies the database as ready or
  fails if it is not at the expected schema version. Useful for a
  migration-role workflow where runtime DDL is not permitted.

The startup protocol is:

1. A database-free build imports only definitions/lazy factories; filesystem
   and network I/O begin at runtime.
2. Resolve and validate config; open **only** the selected backend with
   redacted diagnostics and bounded timeouts.
3. Acquire a backend migration lock (pg advisory lock on a pinned connection;
   SQLite supported exclusive startup/adoption transaction) so competing
   startup/CLI runs serialize.
4. Classify the database as fresh, journal-managed, recognized legacy or unknown
   drift; fresh databases apply their own history, recognized legacy layouts are
   adopted after fingerprint + integrity checks, and unknown layouts fail before
   mutation.
5. Enable/check foreign keys and verify the schema version. A migration error
   aborts readiness — no warn-and-continue repair.
6. Publish ready repositories. Hooks await readiness before auth and scheduler
   start. `/api/health` reports process liveness; `/api/ready` reports backend
   open **and** migrated (login-independent, no secrets). On shutdown, jobs stop
   and DB resources are released.

### Readiness and liveness probes

- `GET /api/health` — process liveness, independent of the database. Returns
  `200 {"status":"ok",...}` while the process is up.
- `GET /api/ready` — backend readiness. Returns `200` only when the selected
  backend is **open and migrated/verified at the expected schema version**;
  otherwise `503`. Body is redacted (dialect, open flag, schema version only).
  PostgreSQL outages turn readiness off and return controlled errors.

Use `/api/ready` for orchestrator readiness/health checks. In
[`compose.postgres.yml`](../compose.postgres.yml) and the SQLite compose file,
the Docker healthcheck already gates on `/api/ready`.

### Migration example

```bash
# Fresh SQLite install
DATABASE_PATH=/tmp/okr.db npm run db:migrate
# -> backend=sqlite mode=migrate OK classification=fresh applied=7 recorded=7 schemaVersion=6

# Verify the same database (no DDL)
DATABASE_PATH=/tmp/okr.db npm run db:verify
# -> backend=sqlite mode=verify OK classification=ready applied=7 recorded=0 schemaVersion=6
```

PostgreSQL migration uses the same commands with `DATABASE_TYPE=postgres` +
`DATABASE_URL`. A migration-role workflow can run `db:migrate` with a DDL-capable
role, then the app's runtime role starts with `db:verify`/readiness checks.

## Backup and recovery

There are **two distinct kinds of backup**. Do not confuse them:

| Kind | What it captures | Cross-engine | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Version-2 user export** (`GET /api/backup`) | one user's data (see [scope](#version-2-user-export-scope)) | **yes** — portable across SQLite ↔ PostgreSQL | moving a *user's* data between instances/backends |
| **Native installation backup** | the whole installation incl. accounts, secrets, config | **no** — engine-specific | complete recovery of an installation |

### Version-2 user export

The in-app backup (Settings → Download Backup) calls `GET /api/backup` and
produces a version-2 JSON document (`version: 2`) from a **consistent
snapshot** (one transaction). Restore is `POST /api/backup/restore` and is
**validated before any mutation, then applied atomically** — a failure after
rows were deleted rolls the whole restore back on both backends.

**Portable across all four directions:** SQLite→SQLite, SQLite→PostgreSQL,
PostgreSQL→SQLite, PostgreSQL→PostgreSQL. Restored content matches within the
documented version-2 scope. A version other than `2` is rejected before
mutation.

#### Version-2 user export scope

**Included** (per exporting user): values + principles, tags, saved queries,
objectives + key results (with progress, widget-query name and code),
time periods with commitments, daily metrics and tasks (attributes + tag
names), dashboard widgets, metrics templates, daily metric values, objective
reflections, and user preferences (timezone / weekStartDay / bgColor).

**Intentionally excluded** (installation-wide, not user-scoped): other users'
data and sessions, friendships and friend notes, query execution logs, global
system config, plugin credentials, AI configuration and secret material.
Installation secrets are **never** exported.

> **Restoring a user export is not an installation migration.** It replaces the
> restored user's data within the documented scope and leaves other users and
> installation-wide data unchanged. It cannot carry accounts, credentials or
> friendships. Use native backups for full installation recovery, and a
> separately scoped converter (out of scope here) for a full-installation
> backend switch.

### Native installation backup (SQLite)

The safe way to copy a SQLite database is SQLite's **online backup API** or
`sqlite3` CLI `.backup`, which produce a consistent copy even with active
writers. Do **not** copy the live database file (or its `-wal`/`-shm` side
files) with `cp`/`rsync` while the app is writing — that is unsafe and may
produce a torn or inconsistent file.

Use the online backup API (this is what RUOK's own recovery rehearsal uses):

```js
import Database from 'better-sqlite3'
const src = new Database('/path/to/okr.db', { readonly: true })
await src.backup('/backups/okr-2026-01-01.db')   // consistent copy
src.close()
```

or the `sqlite3` CLI, which does the same thing:

```bash
sqlite3 /path/to/okr.db ".backup /backups/okr-2026-01-01.db"
```

If you cannot use the online API/CLI (for example a bare `cp` in a script), you
must first **stop the writers** so no transaction is in flight, then copy the
file (and, if present, checkpoint the WAL). Stopping writers is the explicit
requirement that replaces the old unsafe live `cp` recipe.

To restore a SQLite native backup: stop the app, replace `DATABASE_PATH` with
the backup file, then start the app. RUOK's startup migration check classifies
the restored copy as already-ready (schema + journal aligned) and publishes
readiness. The restore is verified by the `/api/ready` probe and by exercising
your data.

```bash
# restore a SQLite native backup
systemctl stop ruok                 # or: docker compose stop ruok
cp /backups/okr-2026-01-01.db /path/to/okr.db
systemctl start ruok                # or: docker compose start ruok
curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/api/ready   # 200 = ready
```

### Native installation backup (PostgreSQL)

Use PostgreSQL-native tools: `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` for point-in-time copies, or
CNPG backups (managed volume snapshots / base backups + WAL) for ongoing
recovery of the cluster. Native dumps preserve accounts, secrets and
configuration.

```bash
# logical dump (full installation)
pg_dump -Fc -h db.example.com -U ruok ruok > ruok.dump

# restore into an empty target database (create it first; not superuser)
pg_restore -d ruok ruok.dump
```

Orchestrated recovery for CNPG is covered in [CNPG-HANDOFF.md](CNPG-HANDOFF.md)
(backup retention and recovery rehearsal). As with SQLite, a native PostgreSQL
backup restores **only to PostgreSQL**.

### Restore validation

Every documented restore path is validated the same way:

1. Run the restore (SQLite online-backup copy, `pg_restore`, or `POST
   /api/backup/restore` for user data).
2. Start the app and confirm `GET /api/ready` returns `200` with the expected
   `dialect` and `schemaVersion`.
3. Exercise the data you care about (login, an objective, a task, a metric).
4. For user exports, confirm the restore was atomic and left other users
   unchanged.

### Why native dumps cannot switch backend engines

A SQLite `.backup()`/CLI backup restores only to SQLite; a PostgreSQL
`pg_dump`/`pg_restore` or CNPG backup restores only to PostgreSQL. Neither format
carries cross-engine DDL semantics or the dialect migration history
compatibly. **A native backup cannot be used to migrate an installation from one
engine to the other.** Backend switching of a full installation is a separately
scoped converter and is an explicit non-goal.

---

## Backend switching is not a migration

Setting a different `DATABASE_TYPE` selects a different backend; it does not
move data. Concretely:

- Switching `sqlite` → `postgres` leaves the SQLite file untouched and connects
  RUOK to the (possibly empty) PostgreSQL database. Nothing is copied.
- Switching `postgres` → `sqlite` connects RUOK to the local file. **Any data
  written to PostgreSQL after you cut over is not in that file.** Merely
  reverting `DATABASE_TYPE` after writing to the new backend loses those writes;
  recovering them requires a deliberate export/import decision, not a config
  flip.

To move a **user's** data across backends, use the version-2 user export
(Settings → Download Backup → restore on the target). To move a **whole
installation**, use native backup only within the same engine, or a separately
scoped converter for cross-engine (not provided here).
