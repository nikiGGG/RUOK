/**
 * WP10 — SQLite execution isolation through the REAL lifecycle path (Issue 2).
 *
 * Exercises the production `openDatabase`/startup path with a SQLite backend and
 * proves the isolation contract holds end-to-end:
 *   - migration/verification runs in the preparation worker, never on the
 *     HTTP/main thread;
 *   - the better-sqlite3 driver is never imported on the main thread. If a
 *     regression routes migration back through `migrateDatabase` on the calling
 *     thread, importing the driver on the main thread throws and fails the test;
 *   - readiness reports open AND migrated, and the DB file is actually created.
 *
 * This complements the facade-level suites (`sqlite-worker.test.ts`), which
 * drive `runSqlitePreparation` + `SqliteDatabaseServices.open()` directly and
 * therefore cannot catch a lifecycle that bypasses the worker.
